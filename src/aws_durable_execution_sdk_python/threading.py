    """Lock that guarantees callers acquire in the invocation order.

    Locks acquire in first-in,first-out (FIFO) order.

    This class is necessary because in a standard Lock the order of pending calls
    acquiring the lock is not necessarily guaranteed by the thread scheduler.

    For example, assume calls to acquire the lock in order A -> B -> C.
    A blocks with B and C pending. When A releases, the thread scheduler could favour
    C rather than B next, which is out of order.

    This OrderedLock instead will guarantee that the order in which callers will
    acquire the lock is the order of invocation. In the case of example, this means
    that the order of lock acquire would always be A -> B -> C.

    Once an error occurs in a lock, this instance of the lock is broken and no subsequent lock attempts
    can succeed, because if any subsequent locks acquire it would violate the order guarantee.

    If a lock fails to acquire, OrderedLock will raise the causing exception to the caller.
    If there are any other blocked callers waiting in queue, those callers will receive a
    OrderedLockError, which contains the original causing exception too.

    You can use OrderedLock as a context manager.
